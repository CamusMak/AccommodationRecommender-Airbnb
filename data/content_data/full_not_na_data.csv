The view from the upstairs terrace is gorgeous and you can sit here in the shade and feel like you are in authentic Spain.\nThe house is very comfortable with everything you need. Downstairs is a well-equipped kitchen, a large bathroom with rain shower, and a comfortable living room. Upstairs is the main bedroom with a double bed and a further one with a single bed. Both bedrooms have air conditioning to keep you cool at night. The terrace upstairs allows you to relax in the sunshine or watch the sun go down and listen to the town bell chime on the half hour.\nFrederikke is so attentive. She kept us updated, recommended beaches and restaurants for us, and answered a couple of questions that we had very promptly. She made our stay very easy and enjoyable. Overall, we had a wonderful time at the property and I highly recommend a stay there.', 'This is a perfect place if you want both sea & mountain walking close by as well as immersion into small village life. From the minute we arrived we felt at home & well taken care of, from the beers, olives & croissants as a welcome in the fridge to churros on Sunday! We were recovering fr covid & and they wanted to ensure our stay was as pleasant as possible - even bringing supper one night! And the view from the patio as well as good bed & shower plus all the essentials needed for cooking made this our favourite stay. We would have extended our stay if it had been available & hope to return one day.', 'A lovely light and airy, clean and comfortable village house in a quiet, interesting street. We loved our four nights here, were spoilt with glorious weather, enjoyed eating outside on one of the terraces soaking up the Spanish ambience of the street and its residents, and discovered lots of lovely walks right from the property itself. As nature lovers the spring flowers and constant birdsong was a source of real pleasure. Frederikke was so friendly and thoughtful and kindly gave us some lovely treats. She was also a mine of helpful information. The house was very well equipped and had everything we needed. The village was preparing for its annual fiesta so was dazzlingly white with all the fresh paint. We hope to return next year.', 'We spent a great week in Cajiz in February to grab some winter sun. Frederikke and Melqui were so helpful throughout and went above and beyond to make sure we had a nice stay. They picked us up from the airport, allowed us to borrow their car and were super nice and friendly.\nThe flat is nice and as it seems in the images. We really enjoyed catching some sun on the terrace which has a lovely view over the town and of the surrounding countryside.\nCajiz is a great location for exploring the area as it is close to the motorway but far enough away to be quiet. We turned up without a car which is probably fine for a few days but if you want to explore further it is worth renting a car.\nAll in all we had a great holiday and would highly recommend this place for anyone else!', 'This was an incredible place to stay, such a quiet little town without the crowds of tourists. Frederikke was very helpful and very responsive. We would stay there again on a heartbeat!', 'Recommended if you look for a genuine Andalusian village in a holiday house overlooking the valley and the sea.']"

Our space is very warm (electric heating) and bright with two large windows one of them with access door to the balcony where you will find a relaxation area and a small bar for coffee, breakfast or weather permitting. Undoubtedly the most notable are the mountain views which are spectacular. We do not have parking but here we guide you a bit.

Depending on the time of year in which you visit Pas de la casa, you can choose the type of parking.
Let's say there are 2 options (blue zone and closed parking) with their respective rates.
In front of the door of the building there is already a lot of blue zone and the closed parking is 5 minutes on foot.

The best thing is to drive the vehicle to the door of the accommodation, in order to unload things, upload them and then park.

The whole area can be explored on foot.","Mountain view, Hair dryer, Cleaning products, Elvive shampoo, Body soap, Hot water, Shower gel, Free washer – In unit, Essentials, Hangers, Bed linens, Extra pillows and blankets, Room-darkening shades, Iron, Drying rack for clothing, Safe, Clothing storage: closet, Ethernet connection, 40"" HDTV with Netflix, Books and reading material, Central heating, First aid kit, Wifi, Dedicated workspace, Kitchen, Ikea bajo meseta refrigerator, Microwave, Cooking basics, Dishes and silverware, Freezer, Stainless steel oven, Hot water kettle, Coffee maker: Nespresso, Wine glasses, Toaster, Baking sheet, Dining table, Coffee, Ski-in/ski-out – On a ski run, Private entrance, Laundromat nearby, Private patio or balcony, Outdoor furniture, Outdoor dining area, Elevator, Paid street parking off premises, Single level home, Luggage dropoff allowed, Smoking allowed, Long term stays allowed, Self check-in, Keypad, Unavailable: Security cameras on property, Unavailable: Dryer, Unavailable: Air conditioning, Unavailable: Smoke alarm, Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm","{'Scenic views': ['Mountain view'], 'Bathroom': ['Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Elvive shampoo', 'Body soap', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel'], 'Bedroom and laundry': ['Free washer – In unit', 'Essentials', 'Hangers', 'Bed linens', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Room-darkening shades', 'Iron', 'Drying rack for clothing', 'Safe', 'Clothing storage: closet'], 'Entertainment': ['Ethernet connection', '40"" HDTV with Netflix', 'Books and reading material'], 'Heating and cooling': ['Central heating'], 'Home safety': ['First aid kit'], 'Internet and office': ['Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace'], 'Kitchen and dining': ['Kitchen', 'Ikea bajo meseta refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Freezer', 'Stainless steel oven', 'Hot water kettle', 'Coffee maker: Nespresso', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Baking sheet', 'Dining table', 'Coffee'], 'Location features': ['Ski-in/ski-out – On a ski run', 'Private entrance', 'Laundromat nearby'], 'Outdoor': ['Private patio or balcony', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area'], 'Parking and facilities': ['Elevator', 'Paid street parking off premises', 'Single level home'], 'Services': ['Luggage dropoff allowed', 'Smoking allowed', 'Long term stays allowed', 'Self check-in', 'Keypad'], 'Not included': ['Security cameras on property', 'Dryer', 'Air conditioning', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm']}","['Security cameras on property', 'Dryer', 'Air conditioning', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm']","['Clean place and friendly host.

As you walk towards the property entrance, you'll surely notice an evergreen courtyard garden at your right.🌲🌲🌲 It ""shields"" the entrance door and entryway from passersby offering privacy and ofcourse a nice view.

After opening the main door, you'll find yourself entering a small mudroom that serves as a laundry room too. It has a washing machine and a wall mounted cabinet for storage. Close the door behind you, and you'll see a wall mounted clothes hanger.

The mudroom takes you to the bathroom, in front of you, and to the main room (Studio), at your left. The bathroom is small and esthetically modest but offers a shower, a toilet, a bidet and a sink. There's a wall mirror with a led light and a little magnified mirror. The door on the inside has a mirror too so you can have a full view of the beauty in front of you.😏

The main room is where the real spirit of the house is. Right in front, there's the sofa, which serves as the second bed in case there will be 3 guests or one of the two didn't behave.😅 The black wired wall mounted grid serves as a little library shelf and as the house infopoint. A little more at your right, and you'll see the full kitchen as well as the table, the small fridge the Smart HD TV and the AC unit.

It’s also close to the bazaar, which is a 5min walk away where you can get fresh fruits. The apartment is relatively close to Skanderbeg square (10-15 min walk).\nThe wifi has been updated and it’s really good if you do remote work. Also, having a small workspace in the apartment is nice. Overall I recommend staying at the apartment. Good location, wonderful hosts, great communication and comfortable apartment.', 'Milena is a gracious and kind host, understanding and caring. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable, with all the amenities - the espresso machine is a great plus as well as the CD collection! It is a peaceful and pleasant space, very quiet and off the main roads but easy walking distance to the city centre. There is a useful grocery store very close by as well as cafes and bakeries. The neighbourhood has an ""old Tirana"" feel to is that is very charming. Couldn\'t ask for a better space or host.', 'Spacious and cosy apartments near center square (10-15 min). Everything is close to the building - markets (2 min), small local cafes, and big-fat cats near the house also included)) Check-in and check-out was very flexible, because Milena and Oltion are great and friendly people. They always help me in every situation! Apartments has everything you need for a long stay. Everything in the house was in great condition or new.I recommend this house to anyone who still doubts.']"

Lots of outdoor space to sit, and the covered area is wonderful in the heat of the day and as a place to eat.\nComfortable sofas indoors too and it was great to have access to a Smart TV. Beds are large and comfortable, mattresses and we had excellent sleep marred only by the odd mosquito.\nOur only criticism is the location. The Villa is a 15min drive from Torrox via a mix of concrete and dirt road. The road passes a concrete plant, sewage plant and between large greenhouses. It’s not for unconfident drivers as it’s narrow and at places has steep drops with no safety barriers.

Very comfy beds.\nIvan was very helpful when we struggled to get into the building on arrival, very responsive to messages.\nThe pool and jacuzzis were very quiet, only 2 - 4 other people there at most,which was great.\nIt really is a beautiful apartment complex.\nLidl is just round the corner.\nThe nearby village of Cancellada is only 10-15 minutes walk away and is a very charming place with some lovely restaurants, El Carnicero, Don Giovannis, and our favourite was Bodeguita Santa Maria (you need to book them all in advance). There’s also the nicest Indian restaurant 5 minutes away, Jaipur Purple.\nA taxi to Puerta Banus (taxi stop round the corner opposite the Exe Estepona hotel) cost €16 and to Estepona town was €13.50.\nWe really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.', 'We’ll be back!!! Great value! As it’s a shared pool I was expecting loads of people and busy but it was so quiet, locals were so friendly, the pool is huge and multiple of them and really is just 20m. The apartment had everything we needed also and the outside are was a complete shock how amazing it is! Sun beds, speaker, seating area, BBQ and the Lidl is a 5 minute walk. Beach was about 15-20 minute walk and beautiful walk way.\nWe had a couple of issues with the alarm but Ivan instantly responded and fixed it and was flexible with our requests for check out. Super relaxing holiday, thank you!', 'Ivans’ apartment was better than we hoped for. Ivan was very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.', 'This was our first family holiday with two couples, two very active toddlers and a 4 month old baby. From the moment we arrived we felt so comfortable and at home! Ivan’s apartment is a perfect destination! It has all the listed amenities and more! There were games for the kids, lots of secure space! Walking distance to supermarkets, pharmacy, restaurants & the beach. Very easy to get an Uber from outside the complex. So much to do for a family, lovely pools, even walking around the grounds to get a baby to sleep was lovely! We could not recommend Ivan’s place highly enough!', 'Everything was very good and comfortable', 'This being the first we stayed in a home away from home for a month, we felt lucky to get this place. We felt comfortable in the space. Just about all our needs were met and we felt at home even to the point of considering we would want to stay longer in the future.\nThe space is clean and comfortable. All amenities advertised were available. The pool was always generally quiet. Responsiveness was amazing for any little issues we may have encountered. Recommendations were also available if needed. We even got to meet the family which was nice. 😊.\nThank you for sharing your space with us. I would recommend this to anybody as it has easy access to many locations having gone to Malaga, Marbella, Seville, Cordoba, Tarifa, Morocco, Gibraltar, Seville, El Caminito del Rey and small towns in between. A car would be useful but this is definitely an ideal location to visit those places.\nDon’t hesitate to book this place.']"

It's made up of a quaint little cul-de-sacs, with narrow, slightly steep roads leading to each unique house and surrounded by colourful flora. It's these things which give it it's name, ""Punta de la Mona"" (Point of Beauty). The area is quiet, peaceful and very relaxing with friendly neighbours. La Aldea is a little paradise and a chance for escapism. The house is mainly on one level although there are a short set of steps to the entrance with a private garage below. The rooms are spacious, airy & decorated in a traditional rustic style with stunning views of the sea. There's a double bedroom with a comfortable bed and it's own ensuite. The lounge has a sofa bed and both bedroom and lounge have access to the terrace. In addition to ceiling fans, there is air conditioning to make your stay more comfortable. Just a minute walk up the hill you will find a beautifully well maintained communal pool for just the Aldea community. An ideal spot to relax and refresh. The whole house is private for guest to enjoy as they please. The house in general is easily assessable by either entering up some steps next to the garage or if you prefer not to drive down the slope of the cul-de-sac and park above, due to the incline, you can walk halfway down the road to a flat area and go down a few steps into the house. Each cul-de-sac in La Aldea is designed to have parking for each house and a garage. Sometimes in summer, it can get a little busy and therefore there is also a general overflow area for parking for all cul-de-sac residence. Although you will find lots of little steps leading to other cul-de-sacs to explore the beauty of the area on foot, we only park in our cul-de-sac or the extra parking area to respect the neighbours., which is mutual.","Bay view, Beach view, Garden view, Golf course view, Harbor view, Lake view, Marina view, Ocean view, Bathtub, Hair dryer, Cleaning products, Shampoo, Body soap, Bidet, Hot water, Shower gel, Washer, Essentials, Hangers, Bed linens, Extra pillows and blankets, Room-darkening shades, Iron, Drying rack for clothing, Safe, Clothing storage: wardrobe, Ethernet connection, 28"" HDTV, Books and reading material, Pack ’n play/Travel crib, Children’s books and toys for ages 0-2 years old, 2-5 years old, 5-10 years old, and 10+ years old, Fireplace guards, Board games, Window AC unit, Indoor fireplace: wood-burning, Ceiling fan, Heating, Smoke alarm, Carbon monoxide alarm, Fire extinguisher, First aid kit, Wifi – 10 Mbps, Dedicated workspace, Kitchen, Refrigerator, Microwave, Cooking basics, Dishes and silverware, Freezer, Dishwasher, Gas stove, Oven, Hot water kettle, Coffee maker, Wine glasses, Toaster, Baking sheet, Dining table, Coffee, Private entrance, Free resort access, Private patio or balcony, Outdoor furniture, Outdoor dining area, Bikes, Free parking garage on premises – 1 space, Free street parking, Shared outdoor pool - saltwater, Pets allowed, Long term stays allowed, Self check-in, Lockbox, Unavailable: Security cameras on property, Unavailable: Dryer","{'Scenic views': ['Bay view', 'Beach view', 'Garden view', 'Golf course view', 'Harbor view', 'Lake view', 'Marina view', 'Ocean view'], 'Bathroom': ['Bathtub', 'Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Shampoo', 'Body soap', 'Bidet', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel'], 'Bedroom and laundry': ['Washer', 'Essentials', 'Hangers', 'Bed linens', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Room-darkening shades', 'Iron', 'Drying rack for clothing', 'Safe', 'Clothing storage: wardrobe'], 'Entertainment': ['Ethernet connection', '28"" HDTV', 'Books and reading material'], 'Family': ['Pack ’n play/Travel crib', 'Children’s books and toys for ages 0-2 years old, 2-5 years old, 5-10 years old, and 10+ years old', 'Fireplace guards', 'Board games'], 'Heating and cooling': ['Window AC unit', 'Indoor fireplace: wood-burning', 'Ceiling fan', 'Heating'], 'Home safety': ['Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit'], 'Internet and office': ['Wifi – 10 Mbps', 'Dedicated workspace'], 'Kitchen and dining': ['Kitchen', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Freezer', 'Dishwasher', 'Gas stove', 'Oven', 'Hot water kettle', 'Coffee maker', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Baking sheet', 'Dining table', 'Coffee'], 'Location features': ['Private entrance', 'Free resort access'], 'Outdoor': ['Private patio or balcony', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'Bikes'], 'Parking and facilities': ['Free parking garage on premises – 1 space', 'Free street parking', 'Shared outdoor pool - saltwater'], 'Services': ['Pets allowed', 'Long term stays allowed', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox'], 'Not included': ['Security cameras on property', 'Dryer']}","['Security cameras on property', 'Dryer']","['A lovely little hideaway in La Herradura!', ""Perfect hideaway with beautiful sea views.

Head back to the apartment for your beach bag. 3 minutes walk from the door you can find a parasol and sunbed for hire.

We rent it out for summer and Christmas when we are in Estonia. The house is recently renovated and it's really cozy and elegant. Everyone says, ""Your house feels like home!""

We have 4 kids, so the house is great for families (ping-pong table, Xbox, doll house etc.). Your kids will have so much fun in pool!

You can walk 20minutes to the gorgeous Marbella old town and sandy beach. I would be happy to recommend you family friendly restaurants and playgrounds. The house has 4 bedrooms with all en-suite + guest toilet. There is a large living room, all equipped kitchen and BBQ area outside. Lots of sitting areas and sun beds outside + covered terrace on the second floor with beautiful sea view.

Garden is lushy and very well taken care.

Pool is beautiful and it has a heating for an extra cost. From May to October its warm anyway.

If you come at Christmas, you can be sure the house is warm and cozy because we have underfloor heating throughout the house.

There is one parking space in the garden (and plenty on the street) and electric charger for a car.

I love design, architecture and art! Therefore I'm quite proud to say my home was selected in the Spanish biggest design magazine El Mueble 2023 summer edition as a fabulous holiday home. You can see those photos at the end of the photo gallery. The house is really on the heart of Marbella, everything is a walking distance. It's an older Spanish neighborhood, so very quiet and safe (NO PARTIES!).

Supermarkets are in walking distance too.\nThere are bus stops 2 minutes from the apartment to take you to Marbella and other locations.\nWe will definitely be back one day.', ""From the moment we booked our stay, Cristina proved to be an exceptional Airbnb host. We chose her place in Marbella during a crucial surgical recovery period and were deeply touched by her warmth and thoughtfulness. The location's proximity to the hospital made our visits smooth and stress-free. But what truly set our experience apart was the comfort of Cristina's home. The full air-conditioning was a godsend, ensuring my recuperation was done in the utmost comfort. As for aesthetics, her impeccable sense of style is evident in the well-decorated interiors, making the environment feel both luxurious and homely. Staying here didn't just feel like another booking; it felt like a sanctuary during a challenging time. Thank you, Cristina, for making a significant difference in our journey.

The temperature of it was warm and it was a pleasure swimming in it. (You have two beds already reserved for the appartment)\n- Appartment not far from the beach\nCONS :\n- If you come with a toddler, keep in mind that there are two stairs to go to the living room and also two stairs to go to the bedroom.\n- To go to the beach, you have to pass through a little tunnel (which is ok) but again, with a stroller it's more complicated as there is a good amount of stairs.""]"

It’s very central. I was able to walk to the beach and all of the shops. Loved the balcony for breakfast or working on my laptop as well. Apartment was clean and Carol even had someone bring by something that was missing in the Kitchen. Would definitely stay here again.', 'Carol is a very kind and receptive person. The apartment room is clean, has a good amount of space and a nice view. Some people on Airbnb are rude but not Carol. Carol made life easy in terms of contact and arrangements. The apartment is about a 5/7 minute walk to the beach. Has decent places to eat nearby.\nHer aircon is out of this world! Kept me very cool and probably one of if not the best feature of the room. Hoover was good - fridge was good, shower worked well. Made me want to move to Marbella!\nI would likely come back again. Enjoy people :)']"

# A PRIVILEGED PLACE in Les Angles
------------------------------------------------

Lou Castelou welcomes you for romantic or family holidays in the Angles ski resort. Located in a residence offering a heated swimming pool, a sauna (paying 5 €) and outdoor games for children in the reception building of the residence, this 40 m² apartment / chalet, completely renovated in 2020, will bring you all the comfort and calm you want for a weekend or a stay of several days.

Find me on my website: ""mesvacancesausud.com"".

Classified as 4-star tourist accommodation, this cozy cocoon, decorated with care and elegance, can accommodate up to 6 people. Its strategic position, both close to the center and to the places of activities, will allow you to enjoy the treasures of Les Angles and its region at your leisure.
Lou Castelou is ideal for a family or romantic break.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A REFINED DECORATION designed to please you upon your arrival
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the entrance, the tone is set: the decoration is neat and refined. Quality furniture has been selected to ensure the comfort of your stay.

Far from the hustle and bustle that there can be in a ski resort in high season, absolute calm reigns in Lou Castelou which will ensure you a benefactor rest thanks to the double glazing and solar shutters in the bedrooms. Whether you are a couple, family or friends, there is no doubt that you will appreciate this comfortable and well-appointed accommodation!
-------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
# Comfortable and stylish ROOMS
-------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
In the master bedroom, a double bed with a mattress and pillows in Hotel comfort (Dunlopillo) will make your nights soft and restful. A rotating mirror will help you select your best outfit! The decoration will charm you with its Scandinavian chalet style.
The second bedroom offers a bunk bed, a chest of drawers, a mirror from a local designer and a retro-gaming game console. With warm notes, it will bathe you in an atmosphere conducive to relaxation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A LUMINOUS STAY for privileged moments of relaxation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With its white walls with touches of natural wood, the living room of the apartment is a very friendly and bright living room. It enjoys beautiful light throughout the day and a beautiful mountain view.

Decorated with great taste, it will be the meeting point for TV evenings, comfortably installed on the warm sofa in front of the electric fireplace and well appointed under a cozy blanket.

With a connected TV, you will have access to several international TV channels as well as NETFLIX in addition to DVD and Blu-ray. You can also enjoy a family moment with board games on site, or simply read a book or listen to the connected radio as well as your music in Bluetooth from the hi-fi system also present at Lou Castelou

I wanted my guests to feel ""at home"" with a high level of comfort and amenities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A FULLY EQUIPPED KITCHEN to taste the fresh products
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the peach has taken its bite (whether you've been to the market or fished yourself in one of the many premium lakes and streams nearby ;-)), you'll appreciate the fully-equipped kitchen with Lou Castelou to prepare your Rainbow or Fario Trouts. The same goes for mushrooms picked from the many surrounding forests: porcini mushrooms, chanterelles, morels and many other species await you in the woods from March to November.
All you have to do is choose from the large battery of pots, pans and casseroles to simmer your delicious meals using local products from surrounding farms. To cook, you have at your disposal electric plates surmounted by an extractor hood, a multifunction microwave oven. And if the fishing is more than miraculous, your refrigerator with freezer will keep your fish.
If you are a cheese lover, the raclette and fondue machines will satisfy your desires!

For breakfast, all tastes are allowed since the kitchen offers a filter coffee maker, a DOLCE GUSTO coffee maker, a kettle and a toaster. You also have tea, coffee. The dishwasher will relieve you of the dive and allow you to go diving faster yourself in the heated swimming pool of the residence, in an outdoor jacuzzi at SPA ANGLEO or at Lake Matemale :-)!

--------------------------------------------------
# AN IDEAL STAY ALSO FOR CHILDREN
--------------------------------------------------
In the accommodation, children will appreciate the view from the living room, a bedroom separate from the parents' bedroom with a games console, a nice decoration including a mirror made by a local designer.
They will be able to take advantage of a chest of drawers to store their belongings in the bedroom, toys, board games, coloring book and colored pencils lent by my children.
Specific and adapted crockery is also available for the little ones as well as a travel cot.
Children can enjoy the heated swimming pool and outdoor games in the residence under the supervision of their parents.
The resort holds the Family + Label and offers them many activities and entertainment throughout the year.
They will be able to enjoy all the activities offered at Lac de Matemale depending on the season: picnic, grill, canoe, pedal boat, tree climbing, mini-golf, archery, dog sledding, ... (checks holidays sometimes accepted). But also 26 other lakes such as the Olive lake for fishing or the Formiguères lake for its avi-faunistic course. Not far from the accommodation, they will be able to discover the wild fauna and flora thanks to routes marked out by the tourist office or within the animal park.
They can accompany older children to the baths (either in the resort in Angléo or in Saillougouse at the LLO baths).
For the more athletic, two ski schools welcome children in good conditions. On the slopes, they can go to the snake gliss or snow park, go on snowshoe hikes and in the summer go mountain biking or climbing.
They will be able to participate or admire the torchlight descent every Thursday of the winter holidays before offered hot chocolate (and mulled wine for parents) and fireworks!

It had everything we needed to feel right at home inside and out. We could have just stayed in the house and would not have to leave. The outdoor area is beautifully setup with comfortable furniture to lounge around the pool and the area gets plenty of sun from dusk to dawn to just stay there. We appreciated the personal attention from the host: Sylvie met us to check in, showed us around, and had something in the fridge for us to munch on from the road. It was really nice to be able to walk around the area with easy hiking trail nearby. Sylvie was very easy to reach and communicate with and gave good suggestions.', 'What a wonderful stay we had! The villa was perfectly clean, stunning view and beautiful pool. The house was also stocked with household supplies for what we needed for a week stay.\nSylvie was also so responsive and helpful with all of my questions about restaurants and places to buy groceries, etc.\nThank you!', 'I highly recommend this house.

Wake up in the morning facing the stunning Bay of Cul de Sac, admire the thousand shades of turquoise blue and be fascinated by all the animal species! Birds, pelicans, egrets, iguanas, turtles, rays, and more!

Dive in the pool, lay on the comfy pool chairs, read a magazine and get a nice tan!
Then grab a kayak (3 of them at your disposal), paddle for a few minutes and stop at the sand bank. So shallow that you will feel like you are walking on the water! Snorkel for a little while, and then keep paddling for a few more minutes and arrive at Pinel Island. Wonderful place! Heaven! You won't believe it until you see it for yourself.
Have an exquisite lunch at Karibuni, drink some local banana rum and if you feel like it, have a walk around Pinel island, you will feel like Robinson Crusoe!

Then it's time to head back to the Villa, jump in the pool again, and get ready for dinner! Drive only a couple of minutes and go to Orient Bay, or Grand Case, where you will find the best cuisine of the island. Gastronomic french food, local street barbecues, Italian restaurants, sushis... You name it, they have it!
After dinner, if you are in party mood, keep the vibe going and enjoy the party beach bars of Orient Bay, or drive to Simpson Bay and find nightclubs, casinos, karaokes, and much more!

But if you feel like staying home, then the kitchen is so well equipped that you will feel like a Chef! There are 3 grocery stores at only a few minutes from the house, as well as a local fishery, a wine store, a delicatessen store, and take-away restaurants.
Now, if you feel like staying home but cooking isn't your passion, then Villa Cala Mar has a private in-house Chef that you can book for the night!

The next day, get in the car and go visit the island: the most amazing beaches, so many of them that you will have to extend your stay if you want to see them all! The biggest zipline of the Caribbean, the duty free shopping streets of Philipsburg, the secret hideaway Lottery Farm, nestled in the hillside of Pic Paradis, where iguanas and monkeys share their home with you. So many hikes that you won't know where to start (3 of them start from the Villa), private boats tours, sailing experiences, water sports, parasailing...

We just had 6 weeks to make arrangements and Philippe was very responsive to our questions.\nWe stayed in a different villa in Anse Marcel last year, and wanted another ocean view, private villa to relax in.\nThere was maid service three times during our stay. They cleaned the kitchen, and swept and mopped, but if you want linens changed, you’ll need to put them in a hamper. Make sure to ask about instructions for the air conditioning.\nThere was a couple staying in the adjacent guest home, which was part of the property, but they didn’t intrude and were very quiet.\nUnfortunately, the wifi was not working well, the speed wasn’t fast enough to download for our work needs. We had to use our cell phones as hot spots. They said it was supposed to have been fixed the week before.\nThe property manager Gilles was knowledgeable about the property, local food, beaches and very helpful overall!', 'We had an amazing time staying at Casa Sand! The location could not better, a short walk or drive to Anse Marcel which has the most beautiful beach in St. Martin, as well as delicious restaurants. Phillipe’s home is lovely with gorgeous views of Anse Marcel in a quiet and secluded neighborhood, a great pool and the ultimate indoor/outdoor living spaces. Also, Gilles the property manager is excellent, quickly responds to any inquiry and has great restaurant recommendations. Thank you Phillipe and Gilles!', 'Philippe’s place is fabulous! The setting is perfect and the view is absolutely beautiful. We loved the layout of the home and it really was perfect for two couples. Gilles was a terrific host. He met us at the home and was very responsive. Philippe, the owner, is also wonderful. The kitchen is well appointed with everything you need and the outdoor space is fantastic. We would definitely come back to enjoy this home and friendly, beautiful Island.', 'I cannot say enough about Philippe and his Villa Casa Sands property. In the weeks leading up to the stay, everything was clear about what to expect. We asked Philippe for suggestions about a private Chef and boat tour and his communication was very much appreciated. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Gilles, who familiarized us with everything about the house. We found it to be everything we hoped it would be and more. There are not words to describe the view from the entire house and back deck / pool area. We literally watched every sunrise and sunset right from the house / deck. It goes without saying but the house is impeccably clean and has everything you will need. Each bedroom has a full bath and separate mini-split air conditioners so guests can sleep to their own temperature. This is huge. Anse Marcel beach is beautiful and the shops there are fun to check out. Also right there within walking distance is the Del Arti restaurant, which was delicious. It is so wonderful to be able to quickly walk to the beach for a few hours or dinner. Checkout was sad for us, but a breeze (it was great to see Gilles again) and we are already hoping to be back next year or the year after and stay at the house again. Truly perfect. Philippe, Gilles, and Daphnee, than you for a fantastic job. All our best regards! -Randy', ""This is a large, very clean, comfortable, and private villa. Everything about it is wonderful - the check-in process, air-conditioning, bedsheets, towels. kitchen amenities, location to Anse Marcel Beach Club, infinity pool, beds and linens, and of course the view. Philippe was a communicative host and responded quickly to questions and comments. We had a plumbing issue in the middle of our trip and it was immediately addressed without interrupting our vacation. I would absolutely return to this villa. There were 5 of us (4 adults and 1 child) and we were more than comfortable - it was luxurious. The privacy of the villa is unbeatable. I would only caution about trying to walk to the beach - perhaps for younger guests it would be ok but the walk back is uphill and may be problematic. We drove each time we went to the beach and it was only a 3-5 minute drive. The driveway is steep and you can't turn around - you have to go in reverse. It took a while to get used to it but it's a minor issue which does not reduce my rating of the villa at all. The kitchen and laundry room amenities are exceptional. There is daily housekeeping included in the price which was a nice bonus. I highly recommend this villa.""]"

It was easy to get to the beach as the location of the apartment is close to the gate. There is also a very clean pool for your use, except oddly there was only one lounger there. This was low season so it was quiet, the beach bars closed by 6 pm. I had a car which was helpful to go to the grocery story(close by), other beaches, other restaurants and explore the island more. I would highly recommend Valentin's place, it is perfect for a couple, there is a pullout couch but it did not seem very comfortable.

It was a nice shower and she provided a bottle of water for our rather late arrival. The wifi was good and there was a shop a few doors away. She was very responsive to all our queries.', 'I am conflicted with this review so I’ll just be very objective.\n- The location is good but you do need a car to buy groceries. The convenience store near by is good but a bit expensive.\n- The beach is not as advertised. It is small and there is a shipwreck right at the shoreline, so you can’t really swim just tan.\n- The studio is a bit run down. Some of the furniture is broken, the fridge is not the greatest, there is a leak from the shower glass, the bed is in bad condition.\n- The hostess was communicative before our trip but after we checked in no conversation at all. We stayed for a month an she never asked if we were doing ok or if we needed something. For example, she was supposed to show us how to program the safe but she never did or when there was a water shortage and we didn’t know if it was only at the building or the whole island, we asked her and she took two hours to respond).\nMy conclusion is that the studio is good for a short time but not for a longer vacation.', 'A great base, close to Marigot and ferries to Anguilla etc.']"

Spacious veranda with marina just below. The location is of the coolest and most spectacular you can imagine - With the sea right in front.
Ballstad is one of the largest and most viable fishing villages we have in Lofoten. Here it gets buzy in the winter when fishing-activity really has its peak season. Countless tons of cod are landed by many boats of different size and design. This is an incredible sight and something that really needs to be experienced. It will not be more real Lofoten than Ballstad can offer.

Gjermesøya is an island located just outside Ballstad town center. The island is not very big, but you have large outdoor areas that are perfect for those who bring children to Lofoten. Gjermesøya is a sparkling playpen, here it is not possible to get bored. There is also a pier that opens the entrance to Ballstad. Here you can try to catch fish by yourself if you like.

Fishing is one of the most exciting activities you can do at Ballstad.

You can also join real fishing boats on a fishing trip. There are several providers of both fishing trips and ribs safari who also know how to find the eagles. The Lofoten is the realm of sea eagles.

NEW DECK and HOT TUB! Right at the headwaters of the Colorado River, this location is IDEAL for wildlife viewing, taking a kayak to the islands, or relaxing on the deck. Perfect for any type of group, there’s something for everyone at this little slice of paradise! Quintessential cozy A-frame cabin with 1 bedroom and additional Twin over Queen bunk bed upstairs, and 1 bathroom ON THE WATER at the south end of Shadow Mountain Lake. Brand new deck installed this past summer as well as a brand new HOT TUB installed! Nestled on a quiet dirt road and less than 10 minutes from downtown Grand Lake, this cabin has much to offer in all seasons. You'll be able to enjoy the stunning views of Rocky Mountain National Park to the north, and watch the Colorado River join Shadow Mountain Lake just steps from the deck. If you're feeling accomplished, try your hand at numerous trails for all levels of ability and ambition in one of the surrounding wilderness areas (Indian Peaks, Never Summer) or National Forests using our included maps and trail guides. Only 17 miles from Granby Ranch Ski Area and an additional 20 miles to the base of Winter Park Resort, you can get your runs in and return to a cozy cabin and warm up by the fire. If you're looking for a quiet place to relax, you can easily explore over 1,300 acres of surface area in one of the provided water-craft (canoe, kayak or paddle board) on the lake; or even paddle over to one of the 5 islands for a quiet picnic. Don’t forget to drop in a line and snag a mackinaw (lake trout) or a Kokanee Salmon, swimming alongside rainbow, brook, German brown and cutthroat trout. THE BEST SPOT to watch wildlife on the lake, our guests have spotted moose, bald eagles, a rare colony of White American Pelicans, Osprey, and even Bighorn Sheep. The newly refreshed and well stocked kitchen offers a great place to cook and connect with fellow travelers. In the upstairs loft you can put in a few hours of work at the desk while enjoying breathtaking views, or stay downstairs and cuddle-up by the fire while the littles enjoy the “kids nook”. Bustling in the summer, the historic town of Grand Lake also has many offerings for all seasons including historical museums, great restaurants, shopping on the boardwalk, ATV/OHV and Snowmobiling tours, breweries, snowshoeing and nordic trails. If you time your trip right, you may be able to attend one of the town’s signature events like the 4th of July Extravaganza or Grand Lake Regatta Week; or even kick off your fall leaf-peeping adventure.

When we moved to Italy in 2008, we bought a couple of old country houses, and renovated them into spacious (90 m2, 900 sqft) luxurious gems.
As we enjoy a nice house with a good atmosphere we ensured that the house is built with materials that represent Italy as it was, with: travertine floors, large beams from chestnut wood, exposed stone work, sinks crafted from local quarried stone ('pietra serena') etc..
During our travels through Italy we could not find modern, fresh, all comfort included houses and a good atmosphere for rent.
Therefore, we decided to build it ourselves and we are ready to share our place with our guests.

Our property has 3 similar sized houses that can of course be rented for a group of people. In total we can accommodate 6 persons. When you want to share meals there is ample room to seat everyone around the big table in one of the apartments or of course in the garden.

You will find us in a small hamlet called Prato in the comune of Monte S.Maria Tiberina, 2 km from the border with Tuscany in the North of Umbria, in an area very close to the Marche.
We value easy access. Our house is in a little village and as there is an asphalt road to the village, there is no need to drive for kilometers on a white (gravel) road to reach us. The next town, Città di Castello, is an easy 20 minutes drive. Here you can find everything you need from shops to food to restaurants and museums.

Every apartment is built to be a separate unit, you have complete privacy with a private terrace and private entrance. The house is equipped with everything you may want on a holiday; Netflix, (free) wireless Internet throughout the whole house, a washer/dryer, air-conditioning in the bedrooms and mosquito nets on all windows and doors to give you a good night rest.
For guests that are coming in autumn, winter or early spring we have a nice fireplace in the living room that also heats the radiators throughout the whole house.
A plunge pool (3x7 m) is available for the guests from half May till half September. Your private terrace gives you all the privacy you'd want.

There are no hidden costs. All costs are included in the price: end cleaning, electricity, heating (gas and/or firewood), bed linen (towels for every day should you want that) etc.

We can help you make your stay as relaxed as possible. We know the area, speak Italian, provide recomendations and make bookings if needed.

Umbria is renowned for its wine and food alike. Indulge in the picturesque surroundings and the wonderful gastronomy of the region. The area is a great place for outdoor activities including walking, cycling, playing golf, or horseback riding.

Public transport does not come to our location. You will need a car; you can rent one from any of the agencies at the airports you can use to fly in.
The Perugia airport is the closest by at 50 min, but also Firenze, Bologna, Pisa or Rome are all close by, with the furthest a 2,5 hour drive.

When you want to dine out we offer a taxi service (for a small fee) where we bring you to the restaurant and pick you up again (in the villages surrounding our place). This way you can enjoy the food, wine (maybe a little grappa) etc. without having to worry about drinking and driving.
In case you don't want to go out at all, we can prepare a gourmet dinner served in your own apartment for you as well. Naturally, breakfast or lunch won't be a problem either.
On the day of your arrival, the first necessities will be waiting for you and if you want, we will get you the groceries you may need up front (just let us know what).

Another unique aspect of this apartment is that you can enjoy the sea view from all the rooms, where the master bedroom has a large balcony overlooking this magnificent view, the second room has a side view of the sea and the third has a balcony with a view of the sea from one side  and of the ancient windmill from the other.

In summer as well as in winter, spend the evenings around the campfire and review the day's experiences. No matter what time of year it is, northern Sweden is always an experience. The seemingly never-ending days in summer, where sometimes the night is turned into day.
Picking berries and mushrooms, fishing, or a hike followed by a campfire should not be missed in the summer.
A very special time is the winter. Polar lights, meter-thick frozen lakes, and snow almost as high as the house offer the perfect conditions for an unforgettable winter. Whether it's snowmobile tours, husky sled rides, or just leisurely ice fishing, you spend most of your time in nature, even in winter.

***Winter Guests***

While we do our very best to keep this driveway plowed and sanded at all times, winter conditions can change rapidly and make access both to and from challenging.

***We can`t stress this enough***

This driveway has a significant slope. When snow and ice are on the ground, 4WD/AWD vehicles, with good traction tires are necessary. Chains are recommended for all and a must for 2WD vehicles.  

The driveway is 0.2 miles uphill with no parking spots below.

Please consider this when deciding to reserve from November through April.

Please be prepared and plan accordingly.

If you are planning to visit during the winter or summer months, we highly recommend purchasing travel insurance.

Located in the heart of the Amalfi Coast in Conca dei Marini, halfway between Amalfi and Positano, it is the perfect location to easily reach any place you want to visit.
At the same time, its elevated position ensures that our guests can enjoy the utmost privacy and enjoy a spectacular view of the sea, mountains and coastline.
Complete with any comfort and amenities, it is the ideal solution for all travelers. Villa Nenno, with its 200 square meters, allows guests to enjoy maximum comfort with 2 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a spacious living room, a kitchen and an outdoor terrace and garden that make everything even more special.

The master suite, lofted in a beautiful dome typical of the Amalfi coast, has a very comfortable queen-size bed, a spacious walk-in closet and a private bathroom.

The second bedroom is located on the ground floor, with a queen-size bed and a single bed, a wardrobe for storing your personal items, a desk and a private bathroom.

The spacious and bright living room has two comfortable sofas from which you can admire the sea or relax and watch TV (smart TV with Amazon Prime included), and from the living room you can access the third bathroom, the laundry room and the terrace.

The kitchen is fully equipped with all the appliances you may need to cook any dish (coffee machine, toaster, kettle, microwave, classic oven, dishwasher, refrigerator, freezer and 5 burners). There is also a dining table where you can eat and magnificent ceramics from a local producer.

You will also appreciate all the ceramic decorative elements throughout the house (if you want to buy ceramics, we have an agreement that guarantees you a special discount).

The strong point of the villa is undoubtedly the outdoor spaces: the terrace and the garden.
On the spacious terrace there is an imposing lava stone table where you can eat in the fresh air even on the hottest days with a view of the divine Amalfi coast.
The natural grass garden is perfect for tanning on comfortable sun loungers, if it gets too hot you can cool off with the outdoor shower, take refuge in the shade of typical mandarin trees or take a bath in the spacious hot tub.

Other amenities that will certainly please guests are the free wifi and air conditioning that is both hot and cold.
In short, Villa Nenno is designed to meet all the needs of our guests. To reach the villa, about 170 steps must be taken, which separates it from street level.
SITA Bus stop is just 10 meters from the steps, with which you can reach Amalfi and other nearby places.
The Conca dei Marini municipality provides a shuttle service, which allows you to reach restaurants, bars, supermarkets and, in particular, the Conca dei Marini beach, one of the pearls of the Amalfi Coast with maximum comfort.","Garden view, City skyline view, Mountain view, Sea view, Hair dryer, Cleaning products, Shampoo, Conditioner, Body soap, Bidet, Outdoor shower, Hot water, Shower gel, Free washer – In unit, Essentials, Hangers, Room-darkening shades, Iron, Safe, Mosquito net, Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, and dresser, HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, standard cable, Exercise equipment: yoga mat, AC - split type ductless system, Heating, Fire extinguisher, First aid kit, Wifi, Dedicated workspace, Kitchen, Refrigerator, Microwave, Cooking basics, Dishes and silverware, Freezer, Dishwasher, Stove, Oven, Hot water kettle, Coffee maker, Wine glasses, Toaster, Baking sheet, Dining table, Coffee, Private entrance, Private patio or balcony, Private backyard – Fully fenced, Fire pit, Outdoor furniture, Hammock, Outdoor dining area, BBQ grill, Sun loungers, Free parking on premises, Free street parking, Private hot tub - available seasonally, open 24 hours, Paid parking off premises, Long term stays allowed, Cleaning available during stay, Host greets you, Unavailable: Dryer, Unavailable: Smoke alarm, Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm","{'Scenic views': ['Garden view', 'City skyline view', 'Mountain view', 'Sea view'], 'Bathroom': ['Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Shampoo', 'Conditioner', 'Body soap', 'Bidet', 'Outdoor shower', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel'], 'Bedroom and laundry': ['Free washer – In unit', 'Essentials', 'Hangers', 'Room-darkening shades', 'Iron', 'Safe', 'Mosquito net', 'Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, and dresser'], 'Entertainment': ['HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, standard cable', 'Exercise equipment: yoga mat'], 'Heating and cooling': ['AC - split type ductless system', 'Heating'], 'Home safety': ['Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit'], 'Internet and office': ['Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace'], 'Kitchen and dining': ['Kitchen', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Freezer', 'Dishwasher', 'Stove', 'Oven', 'Hot water kettle', 'Coffee maker', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Baking sheet', 'Dining table', 'Coffee'], 'Location features': ['Private entrance'], 'Outdoor': ['Private patio or balcony', 'Private backyard – Fully fenced', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Hammock', 'Outdoor dining area', 'BBQ grill', 'Sun loungers'], 'Parking and facilities': ['Free parking on premises', 'Free street parking', 'Private hot tub - available seasonally, open 24 hours', 'Paid parking off premises'], 'Services': ['Long term stays allowed', 'Cleaning available during stay', 'Host greets you'], 'Not included': ['Dryer', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm']}","['Dryer', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm']","['Breathing view and excellent location', 'Carmela and Mario were great hosts; extremely helpful and responsive.

Breathtaking doesn’t even begin to describe it.\nIf you are thinking of a trip to Antigua this is your place.\nThank you Susan and Kevin for your hospitality.', 'My wife and I had a fantastic time at “Amazed” (house name). We went there hoping for a private, relaxing and romantic holiday – and that’s just what we got.\nThe location itself is stunning, the views are amazing, and any amenities needed are close by – but far enough away to preserve the tranquility.\nSusan and Kevin, the hosts, have done an awesome job of cleanliness, keeping modern appliances and making sure you are completely equipped from the time you arrive – no need for shopping trip for cleaning supplies, washing powder etc. – it was all taken care of.\nThere were very clear instructions and great recommendations on local restaurant etc. and on the very rare occasion we had a question the Susan and Kevin were very fast at replying in a helpful manner.\nI can totally recommend this to anyone who wants a quiet and chilled time with desire to stay somewhere of the highest quality and ease.\nI would recommend the use of a hire car – there is plenty of things to do and beaches.', 'Be prepared to be amazed at Villa Amazed. Susan and Kevin have thought of everything to make this house your home while you are away. We recently visited Antigua and stayed here with our 2 teenage children. We had plenty of space, and everything we needed.\nThe location of the home is perfect for us to go on a days adventure to the other side of the island, or take a walk down to explore and find a secluded beach. There are great restaurants and roadside cafes that are really close and convenient along with a very well stocked grocery store with an easy 10 min drive. Each day ended with an outdoor shower, and a dip in the infinity pool to take in the stunning views all around.\nIt was exactly the place we needed to let ourselves relax and enjoy our vacation. Kevin and Susan were very attentive, responsive, and helpful with recommendations to help us see all that Antigua had to offer. If we were to do it all over again I we would not change a thing.', 'We enjoyed a fantastic week at Susan and Kevin\'s gorgeous villa ""Amazed"". Susan answered all our questions before our stay and we were fortunate to have Kevin as our on island host when we visited. They were attentive, but also very respectful hosts who invited us to treat their home as ours for our stay, which we did. Their villa is beautifully situated with stunning views- private, quiet and peaceful....truly a vacation paradise! The villa has a serene ambiance and is well equipped with everything you need. We enjoyed being at the villa at all times of day, whether for a relaxing breakfast by the infinity pool or a dinner after sunset on a night when we were not sampling one of the great island restaurants. It was the perfect place to meet up with my sister and husband from the UK (we travelled from Canada) for a special vacation. Thank you Susan and Kevin for sharing your home. We highly recommend ""Amazed"" and would not hesitate to return!', 'Wow! Everything about our stay has been utterly wonderful. We needed a total break, a moment of peace and quiet away from it all, and that’s what we got.\nSusan and Kevin have been such great hosts, from the moment we booked right throughout our stay. We were met by Kevin at the villa, handed a cold drink and an ice-cold flannel, with dazzling seas and scenery to look out to. What a welcome!\nThe villa itself is out of this world, and every little thing has been thought of. We made fresh smoothies every morning, took packed lunches to the beach, BBQ’d at sunset, and lounged in the infinity pool whilst watching the boats come and go across the water into Jolly Harbour.\nThe villa is so well equipped. There are tupperwares galore, picnic plates, beach bags, beach towels, masks & snorkels…. It’s all there, and makes it feel like a home-from-home - except in the warm Caribbean sunshine, with spectacular views!\nWe’d highly recommend a stay here - thank you Susan and Kevin.']"

The cabin is a private and serene space surrounded by nature. We woke up to birds every morning and had a monkey friend stop by and spy on us a few times. Internet can be a bit spotty, but I think that's just Eswatini - not sure it would be any different elsewhere. I especially loved walking through the gallery with Aleta and making plans to purchase a piece from an artist I have long admired. Really special spot - highly recommend."", ""We had an incredible stay at the Yebo Art Cabin. It was hands down the best Airbnb experience we've had. The cabin is filled with beautiful artwork and is nestled in the gardens and trees for a tranquil and peaceful setting. We have 2 young children, and they loved playing with the dogs, walking the grounds, and especially, spending time with Aleta and Pete. While the cabin is very private, it was great having the access to the Yebo Art Gallery a short walk away, with wonderful artwork and occasional events. The kids were inspired to do lots of artwork and even made t-shirts.\nThe location is perfect for a short or longer stay in Eswatini, with easy access to the game reserves, great hikes, and lots of restaurants."", ""Wow! What a peaceful stay. The place was gorgeous & we felt as if we are away from the city surrounded by nature (exactly what we wanted) but still close enough to access the shopping centres. It was so cool seeing monkies running around in their attempt to loot the food for the day.\nThe cabin was filled with books,art & board games and it was a bonus that there was no TV for extra family bonding time. My only regret is that our stay was too short & we didn't have time to pop into the art gallery but we will definitely be coming back for a longer stay.\nIt was the first time we saw coffee trees & thank you to Piet & Aleta for giving us some of their home grown coffee beans to take home. The children send their gratitute for some of the organic veggies & herbs that Aleta helped them pick & we will be planting the seeds that you gave my daughter this weekend.\nThank you so much for your hospitality. See you soon."", ""This is our second stay at the Yebo cabin. As always, Aleta was proactive and responsive in her communications and flexible about our arrival. We were happy to be warmly greeted by the friendly dogs including the banana-eating Bull Terrier. The cabin is cozy and filled with art from the Yebo Gallery next door. Normally our ten-year old would complain if our AirBnB doesn't have a TV but he is always so happy at Yebo exploring the art gallery, learning from the resident artists, walking the dogs, and generally flitting about. The adults enjoy it too! It's the perfect location for exploring many of the sites of Eswatini and is near shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. The kitchen is well stocked with salt, pepper, spices, and a nice selection of teas and coffee. Keep in mind that the fridge is a mini-fridge and there is no oven. The cabin works well for a family of three or four staying for a few days. We're already looking forward to our next stay!"", ""Aleta's was an excellent and hospitable host. Her house is amazing, clean, exquisite art (mostly locally made) in beautiful surroundings."", 'Very friendly Aleta and Peter were always responsive to any requests.']"

Possibility to rent a car and arrange an airport transfer. A wooden house, built mostly by my father and grandfather was our home for three years, while we were building the ""main house"". Now, as we don't use it regularly, we happily invite others to experience the living amidst Estonian untouched nature. The sauna is situated basically on a peninsula, surrounded by the river Pirita. In the mornings, you may savour coffee in the terrace and watch how fishes jump on the river or how dabbling ducks swim around. Or why not go fishing by a boat.
On the first floor, you'll find big kitchen/living room, where one of the sofas can be unfolded. The kitchen is equipped with coffee, tea, cooking oil, salt, pepper and essential cookwear. There's a big electric sauna, shower and laundry machine. On the second floor, you'll find two single beds in one room that used to be the kids room and in the other room, there's big king size bed. There's also a baby crib.

Located on a specialty coffee farm just 20 min from Mutare, this bright, open-plan cottage truly blurs indoor/outdoor living. Stargaze in the upstairs sleeping loft. Enjoy the famous Vumba mists from a private outdoor shower. Dine or relax on the wraparound veranda with family & friends. Lounge by the pool. Ideal for a quiet, quality getaway or a base to explore the Eastern Highlands. Before we start, here are 4 THINGS PEOPLE LOVE about the Ruby-Hornbill Cottage:

1 – It’s all about the VIEW. As you can see from the pictures of the listing, whether you’re having sundowners from the wrap-around veranda or watching the famous Vumba mists from the PRIVATE OUTDOOR SHOWER, the Ruby Hornbill Cottage has unparalleled views of the surrounding Vumba Mountains and Mozambican valleys below.

2 – The property is FULLY SOLAR POWERED. If power cuts are getting you down, escape to our off-grid haven. We offer a solar geyser for hot water, a gas stove/oven, and solar for all the lights, fridge, and power needs.

3 – Forget about dated DÉCOR. Our cottage has been recently renovated and has a lot of character. Once a working greenhouse, the cottage has been converted into a bright, open-plan space and is tastefully decorated featuring original creations from Zimbabwean artisans. The elevated sleeping loft (with a queen size bed) offers a unique way to take in the sunrise, while you can stargaze from the studio lounge below-- it features an L-shaped sofa that converts into a deluxe queen size bed. The vintage woodburning stove is perfect for cozy winter’s evenings.

4 – The COFFEE TERRACES and mature garden that surround the cottage are magical. It’s the perfect excuse to spend time outdoors with family and friends any time of the year. You may even spot a silvery-cheeked hornbill or some of our other resident wildlife. Take advantage of the POOL and gazebo area, relax in the loungers, or have an evening by the firepit/braai. When the wind is right, we highly recommend flying kites on the front lawn.

The cottage is equipped with a TV and media library (movies, series, music). We encourage you to ""unplug"" during your stay, but it may be possible to access internet by phone at certain points in the property. The kitchen is furnished with a fridge/freezer, gas stove/oven, coffee press, and all the essentials required to unleash your culinary creativity. There is one bathroom downstairs with a bath and shower and a separate adjoining outdoor shower.

Should you be traveling with children, arrangements can also be made for a baby cot, high chair, toys/books, etc… to make your little ones feel at home. A futon can also sleep 1-2 additional guests. A housekeeper is available to clean the space daily, and the property and parking are secured with a perimeter fence and alarm system.

Such a great location, so close to so many things in Seminyak. We did 1 dinner down at Jimbaran Bay, to eat seafood & watch the sunset. We walked to Motel Mexicola for dinner, sisterfields & revolver for breakfast, potato head is right next door!\nThe hosts have listed to previous reviews which started the second story hotel could see into the bathroom & have now put cement blocks & plants on the wall, so it is completely private now. The bath is amazing! Water temperature & pressure in the shower & bath were great.\nYou walk down a private alley to get to the villas. The GoJek app doesn’t have the Villa on their locations yet, so we just used TADDS restaurant as the point to put in the app.\nThe hosts were wonderful for check in & out & they helped us with a driver to the airport.\nHighly recommend & would stay here again!', 'We had a wonderful stay and would 100% come back! Oka was very responsive and friendly and the villa was beautiful. Location perfect for bars and restaurants and villa was a lovely place to spend the days.', 'The accommodation matched the pictures.\nThe location was good. It is an indirect route to the beach. Everything you need within walking distance. We didnt find a short cut to the beach as some other reviews had mentioned. Potato Head entrance is close by. The villa is down an alley but there is security at the gate.\nThe recommendations for where to eat were excellent! We tried La Lucciola (dinner), Biku (lunch), Revolver and Sisterfields (breakfast). All 5 stars.\nRecommendations for host - some more plants around the walls and gardens would be great for privacy. We didnt enjoy the in house massage.\nFirm bed. Good outdoor shower with great pressure.\nHosts were helpful with all requests.', 'The staff were lovely, on the Saturday night the music from mrs sippy can be heard until late but every other night was fine.\nWe did find that the privacy was not that good, with the shower being outside we found the villa near the pools their front door was facing the shower and next door is double story and people were able to look into the villa and the room from their veranda.', 'We had a wonderful stay at the villa. Oka was amazing he picked us up from the airport very late at night and got us to the villa safely as well as took us back to the airport. He was very helpful and knowledgeable with the local area and he arranged for a scooter to be delivered to the villa. Sri and Sary were so great, they came everyday to clean the villa and were always so sweet and accommodating. They helped schedule massages in the villa which were great!\nThe pictures on the Airbnb website very much represented the villa and what it looked like, I would say that the villa could use a little bit of maintenance, it could use a fresh coat of paint and the outside wall near the pool could be washed down it looked like maybe bird droppings on it.\nOverall we had a fabulous vacation and the service was top notch. I would recommend this villa.', 'Very beautiful place, with very friendly staff. They helped with every request and were always there if we needed something.']"

_____________________

*** PLEASE NOTE, BEACH TIDES APRIL - SEPTEMBER ***
Many beaches along the west coast have shallow waters at seasonal times.
During APRIL TO SEPTEMBER, Hin Kong beach turns into a huge playground with low tide, where the waters will be shallow here with a slightly higher tide in the evenings and more a calm sea. Swimming during the day wont be possible, but the evenings bring more water to have a cool dip. Its a great spot for kids to play in. The beach turns into a huge playground, great for walks, shell and crab picking (which the thai locals love to do in the evenings to feed their familes) or to stroll & run around freely. We have lived in this same area for over 9 years now and LOVE this location as its perfect for us with our little boy! There are also an array of Pools around the island to use during low tide and many other beaches close by to visit and explore as well!

In our opinion Need a wee bit more in kitchen in terms of cloths & a cleaning fluid of some sort to wipe surfaces.\nAs it was advertised as daily service, I did expect daily sweeping of Villas as well as rubbish removal, the only daily service we got really was rubbish removed. That is an observation, not criticism.\nMy only big disappointment here was that I had specifically booked what I thought was a sea frontage villa and I had requested that. I wasn't informed that wasn't the case so I was surprised that ours was placed further into the garden area. I had made the booking based on one of 2 villas on Air BNB and it had been made 6 months in advance of trip. If that can't be the allocation then I feel that should have been mentioned.\nThe booklet produced was really helpful as was communication and help offered to get us there. Great stay, thank you"", 'We had a lovely time and the villa is just as pictured, beautiful setting and comfortable accommodations. We were a family of 5 and one toddler and enjoyed spending time together in the kitchen and main rooms. Since I was pregnant and we were with a toddler, we found some things to be a little inconvenient for us. We were not to drink or brush teeth with the water so we had to provide our own. Also there is a river mouth next to the beach so the water is not advised for swimming. Pool was a little cold and the house and pool not the most toddler proof. Great tidepools at low tide though! Overall I would recommend but I would have liked to know those things since our party in particular had some special considerations.', 'Fabulous! We would like to come again. Extremely comfortable, beautiful view, right at the beach, pool, spacious, … The people were very helpful.', 'Staying at the Malequerquer villas was one of the best decisions we made during the trip. It is such a great price for a beautiful, spacious villa. Not only is the pool and central area gorgeous, but the view overlooks this calm bay that you can go down and explore. The sunrises and sunsets were so pretty, we found ourselves wanting to stay rather than go out and explore. Additionally, the villagers across the river were so friendly. They invited me to go play with them, and it truly made the experience that much better. Bridget helped me plan a driver form the airport as well as a delivery rental car service that was extremely convenient. This was by far the best airbnb I have ever booked and it is such a great location in Fiji!', ""What an amazing place! we stayed here with our 2 young kids for 6 nights. Kelera & Rusi were very helpful and friendly without being intrusive. , Kelera even got her sons to pick us some coconuts and delivery them to our room. The pictures don't do this place justice.... It is a really beautiful slice of paradise. Morning jogs through the neighboring villages is picturesque with plenty of friendly locals yelling Bula! from their houses. We would return to the villas in a heart beat!"", 'We loved our stay, great spot for a family break with a couple of young grandkids!']"

It was not only beautiful, comfortable with amazing indoor and outdoor living spaces, but the kitchen was fully stocked with teas, condiments, fresh spices, olive oils and vinegars and they even had a washer and dryer with detergent for use. We had a fire each evening which was so relaxing and so easy to put the wood in and let it burn. We did not realize that there was a cleaning person that came every day to cleanup and refresh the linens, etc. It was just what we needed as we prepared for guests for my daughter's wedding."", 'Check-in was problematic; incomplete keys, we couldn’t open certain doors or windows easily. Alarm wasn’t available for use at first, we had to request for the remote control. The extras Nox offers, specifically cots, was a confusing process; I was sure I had ordered two cots for the full duration, only to find out that it was one cot for a day short of the duration of stay. I had to complain to get this rectified and was charged extra, although it was eventually drastically discounted.\nNox did rectify all the problems, but it was still unpleasant to be disappointed by unnecessary complications upon arrival.\nI do appreciate that I was the first guest at this location (at least the listing said so) and that there’ll be inevitable teething problems; however, Nox should have sorted these out.\nI was told backup power doesn’t work; however, I had to figure out myself it’s a manual switchover. Even so, the backup system is woefully inadequate to last higher load shedding levels.']"

Originally, it belonged to my grandparents, my parents renovated it ten years ago and is now my family’s house and guest house.
Our guest house is located on a quiet mountain landscape area, but near to the most important tourist attractions: Bran Castle (5 km), Rasnov Fortress (20 km), Bear Sanctuary (18 km), City of Brasov (35 km) and Carpathian Mountains (Natural Park Bucegi Mountains and National Park Piatra Craiului Mountains). The house is surrounded by 18 000 square meters land – garden, yard, orchard, pasture, a little farm and a hill waiting to be escalated by our guests.
In our guest house we have 5 double rooms; 3 bedrooms with private bathrooms and 2 bedrooms with shared bathroom (perfect for familly with children). All rooms are on the first floor of house, which is reserved just for guests.
You’ll notice a local traditional style in the rooms, with wood panels and terracotta stove.
On the first floor of the house, there is also a living room where meals can be served or just for spending time. There are also two balconies from where you can admire the view.
My parents and I live on the ground floor. There, our guests have access to the fully equipped kitchen and a big living room for groups with more than 5 people.
For more privacy the house has two different entrances, so you can be independent.
Oh, and under the house, there is a stone cellar where my mom keeps all the home-made delights and my dad his “palinca” (a traditional alcoholic drink).
Outside, there is a wooden pavilion with big windows, a barbecue and a swing for relaxing moments.
My family and I love traditional Romanian meals; my mom is a great cook and she’s using natural products like eggs, milk, meat, round pressed and smoked cheese, from our little farm.
We are happy to cook for our guests but please ask us in advance about the menu and prices. - By car – access from national route DN 73
- By bus – from “Autogara 2” Brasov station to Center of Moieciu Village (bus ticket price 8 RON (1.8 EUR)/person)
My father is always happy to show guests our little farm with chickens, sheep, a pig and a cow. If you want to milk a cow just tell us.
Some of the activities that our guests can practice in the area are: hiking, mountain biking, trail running, skiing, equitation, observation of the nature and fauna, photo tours, climbing, caving.

Hiking.
Bran Country is a starting point to the numerous mountain trails from Piatra Craiului and Bucegi mountains. Whether you prefer the lowlands surrounding the villages in Bran area, or you are willing to discover more challenging routes like the top of Piatra Craiului Ridge, you can find here marvelous opportunities for hiking, to the liking and physical condition of any traveller.
Wherever you choose to go, you will be surprised by the picturesque landscape and friendly people . Discover this area slowly, on foot and take time to admire the traditional architecture of houses scattered along the hills. Don’t leave without trying “bulz” – a rich mix of polenta and sheep milk cheese matured in pine bark.

Mountain biking
Bran country is an ideal choice for mountain cycling and mountain biking, offering many alternative routes with varying degrees of difficulty, easier routes for families and less experienced or less trained people, and more difficult ones dedicated to experienced people who are looking for powerful challenges.
Do not hesitate to contact me and I can be your local guide and I’ll make all the necessary preparation for an unforgettable experience, at the same time sharing with you precious information about the area and its legends.

Forest bathing, earthing and resetting your circadian rhythm is our specialty. If you desire to invest in your mental wellness, or wish to connect with your inner voice or your partner, you've come to the right place. If you have an interest in learning how to maintain a private forest or have questions about treehouses, we can help you there, too. We are an educational, wellness sanctuary. Special note: events and micro weddings must seek prior approval. Please inquire for more information.

Location:
We are located in a protected valley near Puget Sound in unincorporated Olympia, WA. Quick and easy access to I-5 and 10 minutes away from grocery stores, restaurants, and wild life refuges.

This treehouse is nestled in the back woods of our property of 14 acres. Limited views through the trees of the main house can be seen from a distance. We do reside on site and are available to assist guests whenever needed.

Restrictions:
This is an adult only, non-smoking, no-pet space, with a maximum of two adult guests. Due to the nature of this treehouse, you must be in very good physical shape to climb stairs, ladders and be under the weight limit of 200 lbs. No visitors are allowed without prior approval.

Description:
The treehouse is approximately 195 sq. ft. with additional outdoor spaces for cooking and dining. The sleeping loft has a full sized bed, and the highest point inside the sleeping loft is 5'9"". The bathroom is in a separate building with a composting toilet and sink on the ground level below the treehouse. The shower house (generally winterized November 15 until March 1st) is located near the parking area, 500 ft away.

WIFI can be spotty in inclement, windy, or humid weather. Some devices pick up the WIFI signal better than others. The tv operates by WiFi and always works well.

Primitive Cooking:

There is no refrigerator or microwave. There is a Keurig coffee /hot water machine inside the treehouse with complimentary coffee, creamers and sweeteners.
On the deck and in the outdoor food prep area are two large coolers to keep your food and beverages fresh. There is a double sink with hot water, a filtered water spigot, and propane grill with side burner. We do supply basic cooking pans, pots, knives, cutting boards, utensils, dishes, silverware, glasses, wine opener, coffee, condiments and spices.

Staying in the Bamboo House, you will be not too near and not too far from everything.
Located at the seaside of Santa Fe, in the middle of a lush & quiet tropical garden; The Bamboo House is 50 steps from an empty white sand beach offering breathtaking sunsets, 8 minutes from Cloud 9 and away from the crowds.
This gateway is the perfect place to let the energies flow, dedicate yourself to contemplation and revel in the moment. UPDATE on the construction noises appearing on the recent comments : The new listing Bamboo Moon is now open :) Therefore no more construction noise nearby.
All little details put together are aiming to make your stay unique.
Using all the incredible properties of Bamboo, this Eco house has been crafted to make your senses feel all the surrounding elements.
Each face of the house has opening pannels to make the air flow and let you feel the wind as a natural fan. The tiny pool, directly connected to our spring, is here to refresh you along the day and keep your energy balanced. Our indoor and outdoor gardens, made with passion, are here to keep you connected with nature, bringing in birds, butterflies and enticing smells from our selected flowers.
This house was designed as an Eco House. The tiny pool is chemical / soap free. We installed air conditioning for travelers not used to tropical breeze, it helps cooling down the room but you can't expect a fully refrigerated one due to the materials that are not fully isolating and the height of the ceiling. Please be aware of that point before booking. However with natural airflow and our fans, there is enough means to let it off for the whole stay, even in the hottest season. We will leave it up to you, just try it and you will likely be seduced by simplicity :)
We had some leftovers of bamboo while buiding, so we're offering a pair of Bamboo Toothbrush to each of our visitors.
We also offer WiFi (the signal is satisfying but we still are in a remote island..), hot water for the shower, fresh local grounded coffee and drinking water. Travelers will have full and exclusive access to the whole property, with a direct pathway to the beach and a gate connecting to our sister Bamboo House. The gate lockable on both ways, therefore you can only go through if the guests of the other villa also allows it. The pool, outdoor kitchen & bathrooms are all private.
It is recommended for our guests to have a motorbike or scooter to reach the house, since it is a little far from the mainroad. Please be aware that there will be a few hundred meters of dirt road, that may be a bit muddy after heavy rain (usually from December to February). Please make sure that you are comfortable to drive aside of paved road and all will go well.
From the airport, there are always vans that can drop you in front of the house, for 400 php / pax.
If you need scooter rentals, please let us know in advance so we can arrange it :)","Garden view, Bathtub, Hair dryer, Cleaning products, Body soap, Bidet, Outdoor shower, Hot water, Essentials, Bed linens, Clothing storage: walk-in closet, Air conditioning, Ceiling fan, Portable fans, Security cameras on property, Smoke alarm, Carbon monoxide alarm, Wifi, Dedicated workspace, Kitchen, Boston Bay refrigerator, Cooking basics, Dishes and silverware, Mini fridge, Freezer, Stainless steel gas stove, Coffee maker: pour-over coffee, Barbecue utensils, Dining table, Coffee, Waterfront, Public or shared beach access, Private entrance, Laundromat nearby, Private patio or balcony, Backyard, Fire pit, Outdoor furniture, Hammock, Outdoor dining area, Private outdoor kitchen, BBQ grill: charcoal, Free parking on premises, Free street parking, Private hot tub, Single level home, Pets allowed, Long term stays allowed, Self check-in, Lockbox, Unavailable: TV, Unavailable: Washer, Unavailable: Dryer, Unavailable: Heating","{'Scenic views': ['Garden view'], 'Bathroom': ['Bathtub', 'Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Body soap', 'Bidet', 'Outdoor shower', 'Hot water'], 'Bedroom and laundry': ['Essentials', 'Bed linens', 'Clothing storage: walk-in closet'], 'Heating and cooling': ['Air conditioning', 'Ceiling fan', 'Portable fans'], 'Home safety': ['Security cameras on property', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm'], 'Internet and office': ['Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace'], 'Kitchen and dining': ['Kitchen', 'Boston Bay refrigerator', 'Cooking basics', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Mini fridge', 'Freezer', 'Stainless steel gas stove', 'Coffee maker: pour-over coffee', 'Barbecue utensils', 'Dining table', 'Coffee'], 'Location features': ['Waterfront', 'Public or shared beach access', 'Private entrance', 'Laundromat nearby'], 'Outdoor': ['Private patio or balcony', 'Backyard', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Hammock', 'Outdoor dining area', 'Private outdoor kitchen', 'BBQ grill: charcoal'], 'Parking and facilities': ['Free parking on premises', 'Free street parking', 'Private hot tub', 'Single level home'], 'Services': ['Pets allowed', 'Long term stays allowed', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox'], 'Not included': ['TV', 'Washer', 'Dryer', 'Heating']}","['TV', 'Washer', 'Dryer', 'Heating']","['The Bamboo House is a beautiful and chill place to stay at and the communication with Seb was good.

The Felsenkeller Bielatal was since 1854 a popular tavern and restaurant in the district (Bad) Schweizermühle, until the turnaround. The name “Felsenkeller” has its origin in the cellar vault on the ground floor that is built attached to the rocks. Right behind the Felsenkeller lie two cirques hidden between the rocks. In 1856 the bigger cirque was initiated as “Tempel der Natur”, or “Temple of nature” in English. Later is was known as “Mariens Ruhe” (Maria’s rest), “Linkes Zaubergarten” (left magical garden), “Woddanshain” or “Rosen- und Märchengarten” (rose and fairy tale garden). Now the name “Rosengarten” has been established.

Your holiday home “Rosengarten” consists of the living room with kitchen, a bathroom and two bedrooms. The floor heating with marble tiles keeps you comfortably warm, during your stay, also on colder days.

The living room is stylishly decorated and contains a dining area, a living area and a kitchen. The dining area incorporates a wooden dining table with four chairs. The living area offers a sofa for up to four people. Here you can also enjoy a Full HD TV and a Blu-ray player. Moreover, the TV is equipped with a satellite receiver.

The kitchen is modern and fully equipped with a granite kitchen counter, hob, oven, dishwasher, fridge (with freezer) and all the necessary tools. The bathroom offers a sink, toilet and a shower.

The first bedroom contains a king size bed (180x200) and a wardrobe. The second bedroom has two single beds (90x200) and a wardrobe. All beds have a bedside table and an accompanying lamp.

Outside you will find the terrace (six in total for the six holiday homes) with garden furniture. Moreover, you can use a washing machine, which is located in the utility room, ground floor. There are two washing machines and a tumble dryer for all guests to use.

Room is as described. Close to Marigot, good food and the ferry to Anguilla.\nCons: We didn’t have running water for a significant part of our stay. This was due to on going repairs in the French side of the island. No one knows when they shut it off or when it comes back on.\nWe weren’t informed of this until we arrived. We were informed that this occurs a few hours during the evening/night and shown where the jugs were kept for flushing the toilet in the middle in the night.\nImagine a day on the beach and beautiful evening, return to your room and can’t wash the sand, sun and sticky sunscreen off. Having to use the restroom and the toilet won’t flush no matter how much water you pour in it.\nWe ended up leaving early and finding different accommodations on Anguilla.\nAirbnb worked with us to resolve the issue.']"

Before the arrival, he gave us all the useful information to reach the place, and if something we needed in the house was missing, he offered to go and buy it for us.\nOnce we arrived, he greeted us with such courtesy and showed us on the map every possible activity, restaurant, beach available in town. He’s always been so helpful, granting us everything we needed in no time.\nOne day we invited him to join us drinking a beer, and we all spent such a good evening together.\nLocation:\nIt was the first time we visited Crikvenica, and I must say we’ve spent such a relaxing holiday. Everything in town is pretty much reachable by foot, the nearest beach is about 10 minutes walk from the house. The only issue could be the slope, but none of us had problems facing it, we can tell it helps you keeping fit :)\nBeaches are not exaggeratedly crowded, and are pretty various, from rocky to sandy. Along the beach there’s a good amount of bars, clubs, restaurants and more. Night life is really enjoyable!\nHouse:\nThe house is not so big, but for 4 people is more than enough, we’ve never complained about anything. There’s a bedroom on the ground floor and another one upstairs. There’s a bathroom with a shower, a fully equipped kitchen in an open space with the living room, furnished with a sofa and two armchair, a tv and a bookshelf.\nThe outside must be considered as well, since it’s beautiful view on the sea should be awarded, especially early in the morning and in sunset time. The garden is well cared, with a few olive trees that perfectly decorate it.\nSince the house is located above the main road of the town, the area is so silent and you can enjoy your holiday without any kind of noise!\nOne last thing that I really appreciated is the gym, located in the basement of the other building (a few steps from our house).\nThis is just a sum up of the great hospitality of people in this small town, and Damir in particular.\nBelieve me or not, I’m sure everyone will enjoy his holiday in this place, and, like I do right know, you’ll miss Damir as soon as you’ll be leaving his place!', 'We had a really lovely stay here, it was very peaceful and the outside space was great! The accommodation was comfortable and had everything we needed. We ended up using the car to get around as we had small children with us, and there were some roadworks which made it a bit bumpy, but otherwise it was nice and easy. We’d definitely recommend this place and we’d love to come back again!', 'Very beautiful place! Everything is on high level.

It is a tranquil & heavenly escape from the bustle of daily life. Quarryman’s Cottage is a beautiful and newly renovated one bedroom cottage that was built in the mid 1800’s (it had never previously had mains electric or running water).

Sitting over 600 feet above sea level, The Quarryman's Cottage has the most stunning far reaching views of Lyme Bay, Lyme Regis and Charmouth. As an upside down house it makes the most of those views. The open plan living and kitchen area on the top floor opens via French doors onto a large roof terrace in one direction and a paved terrace in the other. The bedroom and large luxury ensuite bathroom are downstairs.

It has been thoughtfully designed to create a light and airy property with large window’s in all rooms and French doors also opening out from the bedroom. It is south west facing guaranteeing you sun all day and the most wonderful sunsets all year round.

The cottage is furnished with an eclectic mix of old and new. Beautiful vintage wood furniture bought from local antique markets. Ercol 'straight back' dining chairs sit beside an antique pine table, an old headmasters book cupboard has been loving restored to create a pantry cupboard and an old Teak ships door, found on Sanna beach in the Scottish Highlands over 35 years ago adorns the wall. Reclaimed pine joists create the floor in the bedroom and upstairs, the original pine boards lovingly restored by the owners. An Oak and powder coated steel spiral staircase from Italy takes you between floors.

The roof terrace is furnished with a heavy solid wood table and benches plus a BBQ. There are 2 bulkhead lights which at night illuminate the surrounding tree’s creating the feeling that you are sitting within them.

The kitchen is fully kitted out to a high specification with a dishwasher, washing machine, gas hob, electric oven and a gorgeous Belfast sink hidden behind an oak worktop allowing for extra worktop space. It has everything you need to create fabulous home cooked meals if you opt to eat in.

The living area has a 2 seater sofa, side table, dining table and chairs, a beautiful Charnwood wood-burner, a large window seat, a smart TV with built in DVD player and a bluetooth speaker for listening to music.

The bedroom has a kingsize solid wood bed, hotel quality Egyptian cotton sheets and towels, two vintage Elm chairs for bedside tables, a large antique trunk, chest of drawers and a window seat with cushions and blankets.

The large ensuite bathroom has been fitted to a very high standard. A stunning ‘double’ shower with far reaching views of Lyme Bay and Charmouth, a freestanding bath sits across the corner of the room under both windows allowing for a spot of stargazing, the freestanding sink sits upon a piece of reclaimed sycamore and the lighting hints at a nautical theme with stylish bulkheads, one of which which can also be dimmed allowing for ‘mood lighting’ whilst taking a bath.

The garden comprises of various different area’s. The paved terrace is surrounded by a variety of tree’s and is a great sun trap. The woodland area under two large Oaks tree’s is perfect for lazy afternoons in the shade reading. The lawned area gets the sun for the whole of the day is a great spot for sun bathing and of course there is the afore mentioned roof terrace. There are two apple tree's which provide a constant supply of fruit in the Autumn.

There is currently parking for one car on the lower access level.

Heating during the winter is via the woodburner as well as Haverland Wave electric radiators (with thermostat and timers). Winter bookings come with a basket of wood.

Well behaved dogs are very welcome. Parking for the cottage is on a tarmac area with space for 2 cars and a turning area (shared with guests from the studio). The parking bay for the cottage is in front of the Cedar fence.","Bay view, Garden view, Valley view, Bathtub, Hair dryer, Cleaning products, Faith in Nature shampoo, Faith in Nature conditioner, Hot water, Free washer – In building, Essentials, Hangers, Bed linens, Room-darkening shades, Iron, Clothing storage: dresser, TV with Netflix, Indoor fireplace: wood-burning, Heating, Smoke alarm, Carbon monoxide alarm, Fire extinguisher, First aid kit, Wifi, Kitchen, Refrigerator, Cooking basics, Dishes and silverware, Dishwasher, Lamona stainless steel gas stove, Oven, Hot water kettle, Coffee maker, Wine glasses, Toaster, Barbecue utensils, Dining table, Private entrance, Private patio or balcony, Private backyard – Not fully fenced, Fire pit, Outdoor furniture, Outdoor dining area, BBQ grill, Free parking on premises, Free street parking, Pets allowed, Self check-in, Lockbox, Unavailable: Dryer, Unavailable: Air conditioning","{'Scenic views': ['Bay view', 'Garden view', 'Valley view'], 'Bathroom': ['Bathtub', 'Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Faith in Nature shampoo', 'Faith in Nature conditioner', 'Hot water'], 'Bedroom and laundry': ['Free washer – In building', 'Essentials', 'Hangers', 'Bed linens', 'Room-darkening shades', 'Iron', 'Clothing storage: dresser'], 'Entertainment': ['TV with Netflix'], 'Heating and cooling': ['Indoor fireplace: wood-burning', 'Heating'], 'Home safety': ['Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit'], 'Internet and office': ['Wifi'], 'Kitchen and dining': ['Kitchen', 'Refrigerator', 'Cooking basics', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Dishwasher', 'Lamona stainless steel gas stove', 'Oven', 'Hot water kettle', 'Coffee maker', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Barbecue utensils', 'Dining table'], 'Location features': ['Private entrance'], 'Outdoor': ['Private patio or balcony', 'Private backyard – Not fully fenced', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'BBQ grill'], 'Parking and facilities': ['Free parking on premises', 'Free street parking'], 'Services': ['Pets allowed', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox'], 'Not included': ['Dryer', 'Air conditioning']}","['Dryer', 'Air conditioning']","['We’ve had a lovely break.

Relax and all yours to enjoy! Caldenia and Ettrick Rocks is not just a destination, it’s an experience and here’s why?

Situated in one of the most unique locations on King Island the homes you will be staying at have been designed by award winning architects, using large expansive glass throughout the rooms to showcase the magnificent rock formations and the dynamic activity of the great Southern Ocean.

This ever changing spectacle together with the wildlife activity abounding the property, produced and directed by Nature herself, will be enjoyed up and close no matter the room you are in.

Comfortable seating, large chaise lounge, quality and luxury bedding, private ensuite with rainfall shower and cantilevered window seat in each bedroom are all there for you to just unwind, relax and take it all in.

The site favoured by fishermen whether on boats, diving or snorkelling or from the safety of land is just meters away from your stay. Binoculars, although at times not needed, are provided to get a closer view, during the early hours, of the fishing boats pulling up their nets or lobster pots directly in front of the property.

Sea Eagles and other birdlife can be seen hovering or swooping for their catch right in front of your accommodation. At dusk the wallabies gather around each of the homes amusing our guests who at times are seen jumping for joy from one end of the house to the other to get a closer look at these wonderful and innocent creatures.

Food on King Island is abundant and its produce prized and sought after by culinary chefs and connoisseur’s of good food from around the world. The site has an abundance of edible plants, seaweed and crustaceans to forage and to help enjoy these delights there is a well stocked pantry in a dream kitchen that is bound to get those creative juices into overdrive.

There are a number of walking tracks, sandy and sheltered coves, plenty of vantage points; to capture that prize winning photographic moment, that artistic scene with the drama that is associated to the shipwreck tragedies of King Island, that ideal catch of the day for the BBQ and for that moment of tranquillity to share your joy with loved ones!

Come, stay with us and experience the marvel that is King Island and Ettrick Rocks. The home is fully self-contained and you have sole occupancy during your stay of the entire home. The home is one of three luxury accommodations on the 38 acre property and the homes are well distanced from each other to provide privacy and your own personal space.

We found many new features at the cottage -- the front and back decks appear new. Beautiful view out back and you can walk directly onto the beach. The only downside to our stay was the biting midges but that was only on the beach and apparently a common New Brunswick problem.', 'If you love tranquility, the sound of the waves and the smell of the ocean this is the perfect spot! We often were the only people on the beach, although we also enjoyed watching people come down to fish. My husband really wished he’d brought fishing gear.\nThe cottage was lovely, spacious and clean. Lots of thoughtful touches - extra toiletries and toothbrushes, beach chairs and toys, coffee, spices etc.\nWe took morning trips to Shippagan, Caraquet, Tracadie and Miscou Island, toured around, had lunch and headed back for an afternoon at the beach. Tina was very helpful and quick to respond, we’d definitely stay again!', 'Home Sweet Home! Thanks for sharing your cottage with our family. It was a stress free vacation. Clean cottage and everything was available to us.']"
